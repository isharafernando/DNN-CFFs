## An Example for Local-Fit
The Compton form factors (CFFs) are extracted through a fit at fixed kinematics, usually across the independent variable $\phi$, the azimuthal angle between the lepton and hadron scattering planes. 
The fit independently determines the CFFs from measurements between different fixed kinematic bins. 
The analytical fit function (or loss function for ANNs) is defined by the helicity amplitudes so the results can be specific to a particular formalism. 
Without the necessary constraints using multiple observables in simultaneous fitting, there is a lack of uniqueness leading to large systematic errors in the extraction.
