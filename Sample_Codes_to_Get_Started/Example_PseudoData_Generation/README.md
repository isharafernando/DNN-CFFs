# An Example for generating pseudo-data

   In this folder called "Example_PseudoData_Generation", you can find a file called 'Generate_Pseudo_Data_Basic_Model.py'.
   This contains the so-called "basic model" for CFFs with the generic form of
   $$CFF(x_B,t) = (a x_B^2 + b x_B) e^{ct^2 + dt + e}+f $$

   The following parameters are used as a starting point:
   | --- | a | b | c | d | e | f |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | ReH | -4.41 | 1.68 | -9.14 |-3.57 | 1.54 | -1.37 |
   | ReE | 144.56 | 149.99 | 0.32 | -1.09 | -148.49 | -0.31 |
   | ReHe |  -1.86 | 1.50 | -0.29 | -1.33 | 0.46 | -0.98 |
   | DVCS | 0.50  | -0.41 | 0.05 | -0.25 | 0.55 | 0.166 |

   * The kinematics $k$, $Q^2$, $x_b$, and $t$ are extracted from the 'Kinemactics.csv' file. If you wish to use different kinematics, you must either modify this file or utilize another one. When using an alternative file, ensure that you specify it in line #12 of the 'Generate_Pseudo_Data_Basic_Model.py' file. Since we require angle values ($\phi$) to generate the so-called 'Total Cross-Section' (F), the current code considers intervals of 10 degrees, as shown in line #10. This is just an example, and you are free to adjust it to any interval you require.

   * Here, we use the BKM10 formalism, and the relevant definitions are contained in the 'BHDVCS_tf_modified.py' file.

   * An example pseudo-data file is also provided in this folder for your reference, and it is called "PseudoData_from_the_Basic_Model.csv". When you run your script, this file will be replaced by the new file generated by running the code "Generate_Pseudo_Data_Basic_Model.py".
